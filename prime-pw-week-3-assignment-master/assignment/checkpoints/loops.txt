# 1 - Describe the benefit(s) of using loops in your code.
Loops are beneficial in code because they allow you to run repeated action based on your conditional.

# 2 - What kind of loop would you want to use if you wanted to do something a certain number of times: for or while?
The 'for' loop.

# 3 - What kind of loop would you want to use if you wanted to do something as long as a condition were true: for or while?
The 'While' loop.

# 4 - What is wrong with this for loop?
 let favoriteFoods = ['tacos', 'pasta', 'sushi'];
  for(let i = 0; i < favoriteFoods.length; i++) {
    console.log('I like to eat', i);
  }

The console.log is missing some information and should look like this
console.log('I like to eat', favoriteFoods[i]);
}


# 5 - What does it mean if you get a console error like this: "Uncaught ReferenceError: i is not defined"
This console error means that I is not defined in your code block.
